**Lecture 1**

In the first lecture of the course Professor Susskind introduces the 
original principle of relativity - also known as Galilean Invariance - 
and discusses inertial reference frames and simultaneity. He then derives 
the Lorentz transformation of special relativity following the method in 
Einstein's original paper [check this], and introduces length contraction 
and time dilation, invariants, and space- and time-like intervals.
