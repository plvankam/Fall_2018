**Note 1: Higher-Order Functions are a great FP language feature**

If you’re not familiar with the term Higher-Order Function (HOF), it
basically means that 

* (a) you can treat a function as a value ( val ) — just
like you can treat a String as a value — and 
* (b) you can pass that valueinto other functions.

**Note 2: Recursion is a by-product**

Sometimes you’ll see a definition of FP that states, “Recursion is a require-
ment of functional programming.” While it’s true that pure FP languages
use recursion, the need for recursion is a by-product of my FP definition.
